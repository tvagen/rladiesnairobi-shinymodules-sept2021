## Shiny modules

Allow you to break your Shiny app into smaller, and more manageable pieces

### Use cases / Scenarios

- Your app is quite complex and has many "moving" parts
- Your app is becoming difficult to maintain
- You are working in a team developing different components of an app
- Some elements of your app need to be more frequently updated than others
- You would like to reuse elements of a Shiny app somewhere else

_A Shiny module has its own UI and Server logic_

Shiny modules are actually not that advanced, but can be used to develop incredibly rich (and advanced) Shiny apps...

... and they will make your life much easier!

## Let's get started...

- We are going to build a simple **dashboard** of population data in Kenya using _Shel Kariuki's rKenyaCensus_ R library.
- We will develop two modules:
  - A landing page (home) module
  - A map module showing population by county
  - We will use Microsoft's Fluent UI (shiny.fluent & shiny.react from appsilon.com)
