This is a repository containing code for the "Modularizing Shiny Apps" R Ladies Nairobi workshop on Sept 4, 2021. In the workshop, we will explore how modules can help us better manage Shiny apps when they become a bit large and/or complex. We will develop a simple dashboard with maps, graphics and some simple statistical models/analysis (if time). 

We will be using data from the rKenyaCensus R library developed by Shel Kariuki, which can be installed by running the following code in R: _devtools::install_github("Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus”)_.  

The workshop will build on a number of R libraries such as leaflet, sf, data.table, plotly, ggplot2, and of course shiny. We will use shiny.react, shiny.router and shiny.fluent, which are all developed by the amazing team at Appsilon (appsilon.com). For more information and installation instructions, have a look at https://github.com/Appsilon. The workshop requires some experience with the development of Shiny apps and general experience with R Statistics, including functions. We will develop a simple dashboard live as part of the session, so participants will need a stable internet connection to be able to follow along.
